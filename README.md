# BillSplitter
Bill Splitter is designed to make splitting restaurant bills easier. By itemizing a bill, it gives users the ability to calculate everyoneâ€™s individual bill. It automatically does all calculations necessary including splitting one item amongst multiple people. It allows for all this information to be stored in one location instead of multiple people pulling out calculators in order to total up what items they bought. It relieves the classic headache: splitting a bill when everyone at the end of a meal, grocery store run, or even any errand run has to come together to discuss the different payments. My app performs this task for you and frees up the you would normally spend calculating and deliberating to be repurposed as time for you to enjoy company and friends as well as reduce the stress of a social occasion.
